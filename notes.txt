*** Thoughts on Game Organization ***
The game will involve a 2d, top-down maze with the player as the focal point.  The player will navigate the maze by moving up, down, left, right, evading the enemy and setting off traps.

AI:
    - enemy has alertness levels
        - starts at 0
        - first time they see enemy in an area, alert increases to 1


Classes:
    Board
        - 2D array of tiles

    Trap
        - type property (good, bad, etc.)

    Tile
        - type (wall, floor, smoke, cracked wall)
        - boolean hasKey
        - Trap object (property will tell what kind of trap)
            - is set to null if no trap

Functions:
    Initialize()
        - find "corners" (a floor tile with two wall or cracked wall tiles bordering it)
            - add all corners to a list
            - randomly pick 3-5 of these tiles
            - change key property to true for those tiles
        - loop over floor tiles and have a low probability of assigning a trap object to each floor tile
            - trap object will have property for which type of Trap it is

    setPlayerSpawn()
        - set in some "spawn box" that connects to the rest of the map


    setEnemySpawn()
        - randomly spawn; has to be minimum distance from player



    play()
